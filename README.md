# Greenhouse Email Signature Generator (JS)

## Project Overview
This is a JavaScript-based web application for generating customizable email signatures. Users can input their personal details, such as name, phone number, and logo, and generate a professional email signature that can be copied or downloaded.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 and CSS3 (for structure and styling)
- JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)
- Bootstrap (for layout and styling)

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open the application**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the application.
   
   No additional setup is required since it is a static web application.

## Usage Guide

- **Input personal information**: The application allows you to input your name, phone number, Skype ID, and other relevant details.
- **Customize options**: Choose whether to display optional elements like a logo, banner, or social media icons.
- **Generate Signature**: Once the information is entered, the signature is dynamically generated.
- **Download or Copy**: You can either copy the signature directly or download it as an HTML file.

## Customization Notes
- **Bootstrap** is used for styling, so you can easily customize the appearance by modifying the Bootstrap classes or overriding the CSS.
- **JavaScript** handles the signature generation. The `script.js` file can be modified to add more features or adjust the current behavior.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for additional customization options such as font styles, colors, and layout templates.
- Potential integrations with third-party tools for syncing email signatures.

## Troubleshooting
- If the signature is not generating correctly, ensure that all required fields (e.g., name) are filled out.
- If the logo or banner does not appear, check the file formats and ensure the image links are valid.
